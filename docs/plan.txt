1. Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to build a real-time system that analyzes a student’s webcam feed to determine engagement and exam integrity, and sends live status updates to a teacher dashboard.

2. System Overview:
a. Student joins a session using a browser and webcam.
b. Video frames are processed on the backend using computer vision.
c. Facial landmarks are extracted to compute engagement signals.
d. Rule-based logic classifies the student state.
e. Status updates are sent to the teacher in real time using WebSockets.

3. Student States:
The system classifies students into the following states:
a. Focused: Face present, gaze forward, neutral expression.
b. Confused: Brow furrow, reduced smile, head tilt over a short duration.
c. Proctor Alert: No face detected, multiple faces, or gaze away for more than a few seconds.

4. Key Signals Used:
a. Face presence and count
b. Eye gaze direction
c. Eyebrow distance (brow furrow)
d. Mouth shape (smile detection)
e. Head orientation

5. Real-Time Communication:
a. The student client sends periodic analysis results.
b. The backend broadcasts student state changes to the teacher dashboard using WebSockets.
c. No raw video is sent to the teacher.

6. Design Principles:
a. Rule-based logic instead of black-box emotion APIs
b. Low latency updates
c. Clear separation between vision, logic, and UI
d. Simple and readable code
