1. Overview:
The system determines student engagement and integrity using rule-based logic applied over short time windows, rather than single-frame predictions.

2. Proctoring Rules (Highest Priority):
 Proctor alerts override all other states.
a. No Face Detected:
      Triggered if no face is detected for more than 2 seconds.
b. Multiple Faces Detected:
      Triggered immediately if more than one face appears.
c. Gaze Away:
      Triggered if the student looks away from the screen for more than 4 continuous seconds.

3. Confusion Detection Logic:
Confusion is inferred when multiple weak signals persist together over time.
Signals used:
a. Eyebrow furrow (reduced distance between eyebrows)
b. Absence of smile
c. Slight head tilt
d Reduced blinking

Confusion state is triggered when:
 At least two confusion signals are present
and they persist for more than 5 seconds

4. Focused / Neutral State:
A student is considered focused when:
a. Face is clearly detected
b. Gaze is mostly forward
c. No proctoring rules are violated
d. Confusion conditions are not met

5. Temporal Smoothing:
a. Signals are averaged over rolling time windows.
b. Short spikes are ignored.
c. State changes require sustained evidence.

6. Priority Order:
a. Proctor Alert
b. Confused
c. Focused
